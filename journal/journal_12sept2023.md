# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I found the lecture on the Unix Shell particularly interesting and helpful to me. I often got nervous when I had to use the command line interface. However, this week’s lecture was very clear and covered the basic commands that I can immediately implement. I was also excited to learn about HackMD. The split view is very convenient for editing. 

### Bud: 
I look forward to digging into deeper on how to efficiently manage group work on Github by making use of branches, especially when there are multiple users working on the same codes at the same time. I also would like to learn about how we deal with conflicts when merging branches.

### Thorn: 
The online materials are written in detail and the lecture was easy to follow so I didn’t have many challenges. However, seeing others having issues with the Unix Shell on Windows made me worried whether I could smoothly use it someday. (I currently use Mac but may switch in the future.)

## Additional thought
A reminder for myself: since I learned some basic commands for the command line, I should try to access the HPC via the command line and submit batch scripts.
