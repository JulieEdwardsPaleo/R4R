# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
I found the ChatGPT prompt engineering very fascinating and helpful. I actually bought GPT-4 because I realized how much it could help with my research in terms of coding and writing.

### Bud: 
Along with exploring the capabilities of ChatGPT, I'm also looking forward to digging more into GitHub. I mainly want to see how I can transition from using GitHub Desktop to the command line. 

### Thorn: 
I'm having trouble cloning repositories through WSL. I tried creating a Personalized Access Token, but the token won't paste into my terminal. I'm not sure why I'm having so much trouble with authenticating my credentials. 

## Additional thought
I would like to discuss how to optimize ChatGPT or even explore other tools to help me with scientific manuscript writing (of course, ethically).
